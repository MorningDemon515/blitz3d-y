# Blitz3D Y

To build Blitz3D TSS you will need:

* Visual Studio Community (or Pro, whatever) 2019.
* "Desktop development with C++". 
* "C++ MFC for latest v142 build tools (x86 & x64)".
* ".NET Framework 4.8 SDK"
* ". NET Framework 4.8 Target Package"

**Too lazy to build? Grab the prebuilt version from the Releases tab.**

## Building

1) Open blitz3d.sln in Visual Studio 2019.

2) Select Release or Debug config and rebuild the entire solution.

3) All done! You can find output files in the _release and _release/bin dirs. Feel free to delete .pdb and .ilk files here.

4) Note: Blitz3D TSS uses the dynamic version of the fmod audio lib. When redistributing programs built with Blitz3D TSS, you will need to also include the `fmod.dll` file found in the `bin` directory with your programs. This should be placed in the same directory as your program's executable.
